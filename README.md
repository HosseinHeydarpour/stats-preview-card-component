## My process

I used SASS and BEM methodology together to create a cleaner and more organized codebase. Flex-box was used for the overall layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Desktop-first workflow
- BEM methodology



### What I learned

In this project i worked with CSS blend mode for creating the layer on the image. 



### Continued development

I am planning to use Tailwind CSS in my next projects :)
